#Write a Python program that prints the sum of two floating point numbers,
#the difference between two integers, and the product of a floating point
#number and an integer. In each case, have the program print out the data
#type of the resulting answer.

#floats
a = 1.01
b = 4.32

#integers
c = 5
d = 6

print("sum of two floats:", a+b,",", type(a+b))

print("difference between two ints", d-c, ",", type(d-c))

print("product between float and int", c*b, ",", type(c*b))
